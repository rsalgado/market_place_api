## Marketplace API

This is my implementation of the Marketplace API, developed through the book (APIs on Rails)[http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/].
It has some changes fixing issues with Rails 4.2 or the later versions of some of the gems used. Some features were developed slightly differently (specially regarding to ActiveModel Serializers), but it sticks as much as possible with the book's tutorial.
